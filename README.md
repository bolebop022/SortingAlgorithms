# Sorting Algorithms

This repository provides implementations of various sorting algorithms in C#. Sorting algorithms are fundamental techniques used to arrange elements in a list or array in ascending or descending order. Each algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages, making them suitable for different scenarios based on the size of the data and the desired performance characteristics.

## Basic Sorting Algorithm

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple and easy-to-understand sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until the list is sorted.

#### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)
- Average Case: O(n^2)
- Worst Case: O(n^2)

## Advanced Sorting Algorithm

### Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element. It then repeatedly merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining, which will be the sorted list.

#### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n log n)

## Optimized Basic Sorting Algorithm

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm, especially for small datasets. It builds the final sorted array one item at a time, by iteratively placing each element in its correct position within the sorted part of the array.

#### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)
- Average Case: O(n^2)
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
